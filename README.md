## OVERVIEW

**Fisher Planet** is a decentralized on-chain **P2E** (Play-to-earn) and **H2E** (Hold-to-earn) game. It also offers opportunities for **F2P** (Free-to-play) players with its Referral system.

It is a 2D on-chain game built with Unity Engine. Fisher Planet game works on PC, Tablet and Mobile devices. It is universal because it has WebGL technology.

Fisher Planet has **FPT** (Fisher Planet Token) and **AFT** (Aqua Farming Token) tokens based on the ERC20 standard. There are currently ERC1155 standard fungible Fishing Boat NFTs and Fish NFTs in the game. In future, game universe will grow and different NFTs will be included in game.

Players collect fish from fish farms with Fishing Boat NFTs and send them to Aquafarming. They earn passive $AFT tokens based on the total fish produced in Aquafarming. NFTs can be traded on the NFT Market.
They can also earn by participating in Tournaments, Staking, and using the Referral and Loyal system.

Organization
Organizing fishing and tour organizations in real life for the community. First regionally, then internationally.
